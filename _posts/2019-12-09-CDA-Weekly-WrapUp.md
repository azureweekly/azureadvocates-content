## [8 Reasons You Absolutely Need to Use Azure Notebooks](https://dev.to/shwars/8-reasons-you-absolutely-need-to-use-azure-notebooks-3512)

**by: Dmitry Soshnikov**

If you are a data scientist or machine learning software engineer as I am, you probably write most of your code in Jupyter Notebooks. The way most data scientists work is to install their own copy of Python dev environment (such as Anaconda or even better Miniconda) on their computer, start Jupyter server and then edit/run code on your own PC/Mac.
However, using cloud resources as notebook dev environment sounds like even better alternative. This is exactly what Azure Notebooks are --- public Jupyter server hosted in the Azure cloud, which you can use from anywhere through the browser to write your code.

There are many advantages of using Azure Notebooks instead of local Jupyter installation, and Dmitry covers them in this article.
