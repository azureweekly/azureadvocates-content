## [Using The Microsoft Face API to Determine Your Mario Kart Zodiac Sign](https://medium.com/@chloecondon/using-the-microsoft-face-api-to-create-mario-kart-astrology-9a187cec4f35)

**by: Chloe Condon**

If you've ever thought your Mario Kart player said more about you than your horoscope sign ever has, you're not alone.  In this post, Chloe details how she built a small site and demo, showing how you can use Azure Cognitive Services Face API to determine characteristics from Mario Kart cosplayers and display "horoscope" data.

This project may be a slightly silly one, but check it out for a fun way to play with the Face API, learn more about the capabilities of Azure Cognitive Services, and display data in an easily consumable way.

## [Security Learns to Sprint: DevSecOps](https://youtu.be/otmF5KD15o4)

**by: Tanya Janca**

In this talk at the RSA Conference, Tanya Janca argues that DevOps could be the best thing to happen to application security since OWASP - if only developers and operations teams were enabled make security a part of their everyday work. 

To do this, we must build security into each of the “Three Ways”: if developers and operations teams are sprinting, then we need to sprint too. 

So put on your running shoes, it’s time for DevSecOps! You'll learn what DevOps is, what DevSecOps is, and 21 ideas for adding security to DevOps.

## [Auto Blogging Jekyll with Logic Apps, ACI Containers and .NET Core](https://tattoocoder.com/auto-blogging-jekyll-with-logic-apps-aci-containers-and-net-core/)

**by: Shayne  Boyer**

Automating readable content isn't always easy - you need a good set of ingredients for any recipe to come out well - and, let's be honest, even the best recipe can be poorly executed.

Jekyll is a well-known way to easily enable a blog engine hosted on GitHub pages: edit some markdown and commit the new document, wait a few moments, and poof we have a new blog post. But how can all of this happen seamlessly and with little or no intervention?

Azure Logic Apps are a fun, productive way to build process flows, and in this case, Shayne uses .NET Core inside of a Docker container, an API to a CMS backend, and Azure Logic Apps to produce content using a code, containers and approval process - without any manual steps.

Going deeper on Kubernetes in the second part of a 5-part series looking at Kubernetes from the beginning. 

In Part II we look at Nodes and Pods once more with a recap on their importance and a deeper dive into their workings. 

We then take a look at Services, which help with routing and access to pods, before explaining labels, which as you might expect, help us in the organisation. 

Finally, theres a chance to get hands on and create a service of our own.
