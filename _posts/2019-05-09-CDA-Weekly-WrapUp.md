## [Building Rootless Applications and Services](https://dev.to/azure/building-rootless-applications-and-services-12if)

**by: Jennifer Davis**

In this Azure April post, Jennifer dives in a "hidden danger" lurking that we don't often talk about: the glue of how our apps and systems work or talk to each other.

Get her take on "to root or not to root?" - including why running something with elevated privileges is risky, especially in cloud-native environments, and how to limit the impact of accidents and attack (plus bonus tips on how to use role based access control (RBAC) for Azure).

## [(Playlist) Video Series about the Azure Cloud Shell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLddMzSrepwAhFKJ2hvWhiQGMC0Qe1w95P )

**by: Thomas Maurer**

Cloud Shell offers a browser-accessible, pre-configured shell experience for managing Azure resources without the overhead of installing, versioning, and maintaining a machine yourself. Azure Cloud Shell is assigned per unique user account and automatically authenticated with each session. This makes it a private and secure environment.

You get a modern web-based command line experience which can be accessed from several end points like the Azure Portal, shell.azure.com and the Azure mobile app, Visual Studio Code or directly in the Azure docs.

This playlist gives you an overview about the different features of Azure Cloud Shell.

## [Preview Web Apps with Azure Cloud Shell Web Preview](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/05/preview-web-apps-with-azure-cloud-shell-web-preview/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

If you have worked with the Azure Cloud Shell in the last couple of days, you might have seen a new button called Web Preview. The Azure Cloud Shell Web preview feature allows you to run web applications on the Cloud Shell container instance and preview them before you deploy them. You can run web applications that listen to HTTP requests on the Cloud Shell from port 1025-8079 and 8091-49151.

If you are running for example a .NET Core application in Cloud Shell, you can preview this to the Cloud Shell gateway.

In this tutorial, Thomas shows readers how to use the Azure Cloud Shell Web preview feature.

## [Java Dev Environments with Containers](https://medium.com/@brunoborges/java-dev-environments-with-containers-66d6797b2753)

**by: Bruno Borges**

Development environments are not always easy to set up or keep tidy -- and for Java developers, it requires, at the very minimum, installing JDK, an editor, and a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

But, what if you could go from zero to hero without having to install JDK, Maven, Gradle etc?

You can.

In this post, you'll see how to go from zero to here with pre-baked Java dev environments inside containers.

With the combo of Visual Studio Code (insiders, for now), the Remote Development extension pack, and Docker Desktop, you'll get up and running on your computer, without having to install anything else.

## [Giving TodoMVC the API It Deserves: Part 1 - Todo Creation](https://dev.to/azure/giving-todo-mvc-the-api-it-deserves-part-1-todo-creation-19h4)

**by: Ryan Levick**

Todo MVC is a great "hello world" app way to compare different JavaScript frameworks and see how to build an app that's slightly more complex than what can easily fit in a README.

In this series, we'll start where Todo MVC left off, and build a backend for the app that syncs your todos across devices - starting with creating a function and hooking it up with a newly created Table Storage account (living in Azure).

In the next post we'll create a "GetTodos" endpoint for fetching our todos, and we'll deploy our function to Azure so we don't need to run it locally.

Throughout each post, I'll dive into the different possibilities inside one particular cloud provider, Azure --but the hope is that eventually others can add similar tutorials for other cloud providers.

## [Improve your Dockerfile, Best Practices](https://dev.to/azure/improve-your-dockerfile-best-practices-5ll)

**by: Chris Noring**

If you know your way around Docker, you've likely run into Dockerfiles - using them to specify what your Docker images contain, whether it's the OS, libraries, environment variables, or something else.

Chris shares why "make your image sizes as small as possible" is his one of his favorite Dockerfile best practices, then walks you through how to make your images as small, fast, and performant as possible.

## [Azure Casts Episode 007 - When Node.js Dies](https://azurecasts.com/2019/05/04/when-node-dies/)

**by: Burke Holland**

An unhandled exception in a Node application can crash the whole process - taking your site offline completely.

Even if you try to trap the error in a try/catch block, it can still find a way to die -- and, while frameworks like Express and Koa have safeguards built-in, it's still a good idea to use a process manager.

In this video, Burke Holland Azure restarts a dead Node application using Docker container orchestration -- and then shows you an even better (read: more affordable) way.

You'll see how to use Azure App Service and PM2 to run Node applications >> you tweak the restart rules and create multiple Node processes in a cluster.

Deep Learning is one of the buzziest of tech buzzwords at the moment -- and this session is designed to remove the mysticism from this (amazing) form of Artificial Intelligence.

You'll be led through the wilderness of modern machine learning's underlying foundational principles until you reach the oasis of full-fledged understanding of deep learning for computer vision.

While this session is not for the faint of heart, initiates will leave with a  solid understanding of machine learning basics *and* advanced scenarios - going all the way through powerful image-deciphering convolutional neural networks.

## [How to Configure Windows Sandbox](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/05/how-to-configure-windows-sandbox/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

With the latest release of Windows 10 (1903), Microsoft introduced a new feature called Windows Sandbox: a built-in lightweight virtual machine that's based on Hyper-V technology that allows you to spin up an isolated, temporary, desktop environment to run untrusted software - great for demos, troubleshooting, or situations where you're dealing with malware.

In this short post, Thomas walks you through how to get started  - from prerequisites to set up and install to customizing your environment with advanced configurations and various settings.
