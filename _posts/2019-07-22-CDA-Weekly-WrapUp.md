## [DevSecOps with OWASP DevSlop by Nancy Garche & Tanya Janca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8i67HFrgUE)

**by: Tanya Janca**

This is a recording of Tanya Janca's talk at the OWASP Global AppSec conference in Tel Aviv.

The OWASP DevSlop team is dedicated to learning and teaching DevSecOps via examples, and “Patty the Pipeline” is no exception: they ensure all the 3rd party components are known-secure, retrieve secrets from a secret store, and the code must pass negative unit tests, dynamic application security testing (DAST), static application security testing (SAST), and encryption and infrastructure VA verification.  This entire system/project is open-sourced as part of the OWASP DevSlop project on GitHub and as live streaming and recorded videos, so that developers can watch each of the lessons, add it to their own pipelines, giving them a head start on DevSecOps. The talk will consist mostly of a start-to-finish demo of each part of the pipeline. Tools showcased include SSL Labs, White Source Bolt, Azure DevOps Security Toolkit and OWASP Zap.

## [Home Grown IoT, Part VII - Simple DevOps](https://dev.to/azure/home-grown-iot-simple-devops-11n9)

**by: Aaron Powell**

When it comes to CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) for IoT projects, it can feel a bit daunting -- and Aaron documents his process to help developers everywhere apply CI/CD to their own projects. 

In this post - the start of a series in "DevOps with IoT" - Aaron focuses on the tools before Azure Pipelines. He takes you through Azure IoT Edge, defining Modules to run your device as a Docker Container,  and using the Azure CLI to create a deployment for devices to pick up.

Next time, he'll move away from executing the commands himself and control it all via Azure Pipelines.
