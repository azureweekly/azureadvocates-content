## [Joi — Awesome Code Validation for Node.js and Express](https://dev.to/itnext/joi-awesome-code-validation-for-node-js-and-express-35pk)

**by: Chris Noring**

We tend to perform a lot of tests on our parameters to ensure they are the right and/or their values contains the allowed values -- but this can lead to less than ideal looking code.

In this post, Chris tackles API validation, introducing Joi - a validation library that allows developers to validate objects and incoming requests. You'll get a tour through Joi’s feature, then dive into an example scenario for backend middleware and Request Pipelines.

## [Reverse Engineering - Understanding Spies in Testing](https://dev.to/itnext/reverse-engineering-understanding-spies-in-testing-3443)

**by: Chris Noring**

Spies mock responses from dependencies and ensure dependencies are correctly called - the number of times, the correct type and number of arguments. 

In this post, Chris explores Spies in Jasmine, what goes on under the hood, and works backwards to build a library to support behavior testing.

He covers implementing a spy from the beginning, explaining the how and why behind each step -- and provides resources to continue learning (and reverse engineering)

## [vBrownBag  - “DNR” Your Windows Server or Maintain Life support: Know your EOL options before the plug gets pulled](https://youtu.be/zQ-Jl-bgheI)

**by: Phoummala Schmitt **

We know they are still out there. Staying low key. But it's time to talk about it -- Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 is nearing it’s End of Life Support, January 14, 2020 to be exact. This means that Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will no longer receive security updates. In today’s modern IT, security breaches are on the rise which can have a multitude of negative effects when you are running on unsupported software. Don’t be left caught off guard when the plug is pulled. Come hear from Cloud Advocate Phoummala Schmitt as she walks you through your options for upgrading to the latest OS, and discusses the remaining Lifecyle for the other versions of Windows to help prepare you for when the plug is pulled.

## [Governing your Microsoft Azure environment](https://youtu.be/ZrxhG181UZw)

**by: Phoummala Schmitt **

In the era of digital transformation it's all about acceleration and agility. Moving your company infrastructure to the cloud can increase flexibility, uptime and reduce your IT costs – but you need to have a measure of control to ensure that only appropriate resources are created and that they meet your configuration requirements.  

In this session Cloud Advocate Phoummala Schmitt talks about how Azure Policy and Role Based Access control are used to control resource configuration and access, while providing developers and operations to perform their job. In addition, you’ll learn how Azure Blueprints combines these settings, enforcing governance across your entire Azure tenancy. These checks and balances, aka "cloud governance" can be achieved giving you the speed you need and the control you want.

**by: Phoummala Schmitt **

In the era of digital transformation, IT professionals are tasked with doing more and staying connected at an ever increasing rate. The technology industry is the  fastest changing industry there is around but the often-overlooked part of this industry is the humans that work with the technology. Humans are not robots even though some may feel or think that we are. However, we are not. There are many facets to humans. We are the most complex machine there is yet we have the most difficult time understanding and taking care of ourselves. In this session we’ll discuss some of the challenges such as work life balance, Soft skills and imposter syndrome that impacting many of the IT workforce and solutions for overcoming them.

## [How to run with Scissors: Acceleration with guardrails for your cloud journey](https://twitter.com/mistwire/status/1151870717178372096?s=21)

**by: Phoummala Schmitt **

In modern IT, you need speed, agility, and acceleration, but meeting your business expectations and goals without governance is like running with scissors. How do you get speed AND Control? Cloud native tools within Azure, which are used as "guardrails" can give you the speed to accelerate your while still maintaining control.
In this session you’ll see how Azure Policy and Role Based Access control are used to control resource configuration and access without slowing you down. You’ll also learn how Azure Blueprints combines these settings, enforcing governance across your entire Azure tenancy. The checks and balances can be achieved giving you the speed you need and the control you want.

**by: Jay Gordon**

Weekly podcast featuring interviews with DevOps experts and IT pros on their experiences dealing with "on-call" emergencies. 

In this episode, Jay talks to Ben Halpern - founder of DEV, a Canadian, and a generalist software developer who writes a lot of Ruby. In this conversation, they cover a broad range of topics, from Ben's journey into tech and co-founding DEV, to the different shapes and sizes of "on-call" in a growing startup. And sometimes, that takes the form of a group of developers attacking a problem to help keep other developers afloat. That's what Ben Halpern and the team at the DEV Community are up to.

Aaron wraps up his series by sharing what he's planning next, from data visualization and predictive maintenance to a fully connected house

While he went into the project knowing little about IoT and planned to run a simple Raspberry Pi and Azure Functions app, throughout the 8 post series, he wound up exploring a bunch of Azure IoT tooling. 

The end result: he can now push a commit to GitHub and deploy to a Raspberry Pi within 20 minutes.

## [Building Microservices, Does Size Matter?](https://dev.to/dotnet/building-microservices-does-size-matter-2l88)

**by: Shayne  Boyer**

Blog post discussing the "size" of microservices, based on the On.NET "Microservices Templates in .NET Core 3.0" episode.

The term is more around the responsibility, deployment (not the size of), manageability, service boundary, and development team -- and Shayne explores this concept in more detail, using a simple Hello World example.

Microsoft Azure Dedicated Host (in Public Preview at time of writing) operates as a single-tenancy Host for Azure IaaS, allowing you to run Windows and Linux virtual machines on a single dedicated, physical servers.

This gives customers more control, better licensing options, and helps with compliance requirements -- and, in this blog post, Thomas shares the key benefits, new scenarios, and then dives into how to set up and deploy Azure VMs on Dedicated Hosts.

## [How You Can Build a Serverless API using GraphQL .Net Core, C# and VS Code](https://dev.to/azure/how-you-can-build-a-serverless-api-using-graphql-net-core-c-and-vs-code-g5h)

**by: Chris Noring**

GraphQL has the ability to stitch together data from different APIs, acting as an API that aggregates data from different sources --  making it work well in the context of serverless apps. 

To demonstrate, Chris takes you through how to use GraphQL to build a full CRUD API  - including queries and mutations. You'll see how to create a serverless function, host your GraphQL API in a function, and mark an external HTTP call part of your GraphQL API.
