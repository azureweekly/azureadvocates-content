**by: Phoummala Schmitt**

Businesses need to be agile. They need to quickly adopt to new business trends, or else they are behind the game. Accelerating your business to achieve success is a must, but often the need to accelerate causes lapses in controls to meet compliance and regulation standards.

With cloud technologies bursting everywhere, itâ€™s quick and easy to deploy. In a matter of minutes, you can be up and running, BUT it can be dangerous if you donâ€™t have the right plan in place.

In this blog post, Cloud Advocate Phoummala Schmitt walks you through an achievable plan for building governance into your solutions (while still moving at the speed your business needs), sharing an incremental approach that starts off with foundational layers.

...and then you discover that you need to configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider. Rather than hand-tooling your DNS records, this post shows you how to manage your CNAMEs via an Azure Resource Manager Template in Azure.

Among a host of other things, this allows you to version, review, and share your template(s) in version control.

## [Learn about the Circuit Breaker Pattern in 5 minutes](https://dev.to/azure/learn-about-the-circuit-breaker-pattern-in-5-minutes-1l45)

**by: Jennifer Davis**

This post is the first in a series that explains common patterns and their implementation in software design, starting with the concept of Circuit Breakers.

Applying circuit breaker patterns from electrical engineering to software engineering design prevents individual services from causing damage to other services -- or bringing down the whole system (similar to how electrical circuit breakers will shut down power in one area of your home to protect other rooms from possible damage).

Jennifer explores this in deeper detail, including pros, cons, risks, and mitigation tactics.
