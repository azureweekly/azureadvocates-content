## [Preload Angular Bundles When Good Network Connectivity is Detected](https://dev.to/azure/preload-angular-bundles-when-good-network-connectivity-is-detected-j3a)

**by: John Papa**

Users want fast, responsive apps. When it comes to web development, getting JavaScript bundles to the browser as quickly as possible is key to making this happen.

In this article, John looks at yet another Angular Preload approach: preloading your bundles when your users have a good network connection - making them available in low bandwidth / low WiFi scenarios. 

You'll learn how to set up and test this strategy, as well as pointers to the other articles in the series for more tips on preloading.

## [Predictive Preloading Strategy for Your Angular Bundles](https://dev.to/john_papa/predictive-preloading-strategy-for-your-angular-bundles-4bgl)

**by: John Papa**

Users want fast, responsive apps. When it comes to web development, getting JavaScript bundles to the browser as quickly as possible is key to making this happen.

In the last part of the series, you learn how to create your own custom Angular preload strategy that preloads bundles before a user takes an action - like hovering over menu or "sign up" buttons or scrolling to a specific area of the screen. If your users' behavior and workflow often follows a specific path before your app loads a new bundle, then this strategy might be for you.

Users don't care about the tech stack or the company providing digital services: they just want to accomplish a task. 

Jason details Site Reliability Engineering's role in enabling users and improving their experience, starting with instrumenting for observability. He walks through how and why we need to understand users' needs and the value we offer them -- and instrument our products to monitor for *those* things, rather than purely technical component level failures.

## [Enable Automatic Updates in a Web Application using Azure Functions and SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/automatic-update-of-a-webapp-using-azure-functions-and-signalr/)

**by: Anthony Chu**

In this Learn module, you use a sample scenario to learn how to broadcast real-time document changes between clients and servers. 

Broken into 8 mini-units totalling less than 60 minutes, you walk through implementing a function in Azure Functions that runs only when data changes in an Azure Cosmos DB, broadcasting changes to connected clients via SignalR Service, and updating your client web app to respond to SignalR messages.

**by: Tanya Janca**

Nancy Gariché and Tanya Janca - two of the project leaders for OWASP DevSlop - join the Application Security podcast,  and we realize that it is much more than a project: it’s a movement and place for its creators to share what they've learned and build a community platform. 

DevSlop consists of four main components, including an Azure-based DevSecOps pipeline, tools for testing and learning about app security, and a weekly live-stream series focused on solving problems in real-time and connecting community members.

## [Why Can't We Build Secure Software (with Tanya Janca)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uep-z8vaXGk&feature=youtu.be)

**by: Tanya Janca**

A lot is expected of software developers these days; they are expected to be experts in everything despite very little training. Throw in the IT security team (often with little-to-no knowledge of how to build software) telling developers what to do and how to do it, and the situation becomes strained. This silo-filled, tension-laced situation, coupled with short deadlines and pressure from management, often leads to stress, anxiety and less-than-ideal reactions from developers and security people alike.

This talk will explain how job insecurities can be brought out by IT leadership decisions, and how this can lead to real-life vulnerabilities in software. This talk is about creating programs, governance and policies that ensure security throughout the entire SDLC.

## [Create your First Serverless Workflow with Durable Functions](https://dev.to/softchris/durable-functions-stateful-long-running-functions-in-serverless-part-i-5bm)

**by: Chris Noring**

This article introduces Durable Functions - an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless environment. In other words: long-running  functions - like really long running functions - that remember where they are, operating like a quasi-workflow, and allow you to customize what happens when.

You'll learn how they work at a conceptual level, then code through an example to see how to apply major concepts in real scenarios, and understand how to use them in *your* projects.

## [Integrating the Data Science and App Development Cycles](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/integrating-the-data-science-and-app-development-cycles-9845da423adc)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

The Data Science lifecycle or "inner loop" - which focuses on (re)training your model, including data ingestion, preparation, and machine learning experimentation - can be automated with the Azure Machine Learning pipeline. Likewise, the application lifecycle or "outer loop" - which includes unit and integration testing of the model and the larger business application - can be automated with the Azure DevOps pipeline.

In this article, Cloud Advocate Francesca Lazzeri describes why it's important to connect data science and application lifecycles, and how you can bridge Azure Machine Learning and Azure DevOps pipelines to make the data science process an intuitive part of your applications' development pipeline. 

The result? No more finger pointing when there are unexpected delays or teams discover bugs late in the process or post-release - and more focus on shipping high quality software and building high quality models.

## [Model Interpretability with Azure ML Service](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/explain-model/explain-tabular-data-raw-features/explain-sklearn-raw-features.ipynb)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

In this open sourced GitHub tutorial, Cloud Advocate Francesca Lazzeri walks through setting up Azure Notebooks to explain a model using AML explain-model package on raw features. 

In machine learning, the process of 'explaining the model' allows data scientists to provide stakeholders visibility into the data points - or features- that have most impact.  Features are the data fields used to predict a target data point, and feature importance tells you how each data field (feature) impacts your model's prediction accuracy (for example, to predict credit risk, features (data fields) could include factors like age, account size, and account age. 

You'll use Scikit-learn to train a Logistic Regression model, run "explain_model on the full dataset and the summarized datasets (both in local mode), and visualize the global and local explanations on a dashboard.

Watch someone live code online…why would I do that? Brian sets out to answer this question for you, sharing his experiences with Twitch, both as a host and viewer.

There’s a ton of value that developers can get out of traditional, scripted trainings, which you can find on many existing channels, from YouTube to Pluralsight -- but live-streaming is an interactive (and realistic) to scripted training that helps you solve practical problems in real-time. 

Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, Brian describes three reasons you may want to start tuning in to Twitch.
