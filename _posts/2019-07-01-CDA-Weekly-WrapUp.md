## [The Open Source Show: Using Open Data to Build Family Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQCbCP64BYE&feature=youtu.be)

**by: Ashley McNamara**

Erica Joy (@EricaJoy) joins Ashley McNamara (@ashleymcnamara) to share her not-so-secret personal mission: making genealogy information open, queryable, and easily parsable. She shares a bit about why this is so critical, common challenges, and tips for re-building your own family tree - or using open data to uncover whatever the information you need for your personal mission.

In summary: you’ll learn what open data is, where existing datasets fall short, and a few ways to get involved and start applying to your projects.

## [KubeCon China 2019 Demo](https://github.com/scotty-c/kubecon-china)

**by: Scott Coulton**

This repo contains the code to set up an AKS cluster with virtual node enabled and install Keda via CNAB with porter.

After installing prerequisites (Helm, Docker, and a few other tools), the repo uses a demo app that scales on a virtual node (Azure ACI) and uses CNAB and the Deislab CNAB porter implementation for automation.

This repo was first demo'd at KubeCon China 2019, where Patrick and Scott talk about three canonical abstraction that help developers structure their architecture: container, functions responding to events, and managed services.

They explain how to use these three components to develop (Docker, local Kubernetes, virtual Kubelet, OpenFaaS), deploy (managed Kubernetes, functions and services) and package (CNAB specification and tooling) applications - including "Day 2" concerns and things to consider.

## [How to Use Cloud Shell in Visual Studio Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ITOps-Talk-Blog/How-to-Use-Cloud-Shell-in-Visual-Studio-Code/ba-p/663431?WT.mc_id=itopstalk-blog-thmaure)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

If you often edit files and write code and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates in Visual Studio Code, you probably either use a local Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI installation, or switch from Visual Studio Code to your browser to run Cloud Shell.

However, there is also a third option: run Cloud Shell directly within Visual Studio Code. In this short article and how-to video, Thomas shows how you can set up Cloud Shell in Visual Studio Code in a few straightforward steps.

**by: Amy Boyd**

In this two part series, Amy Boyd uses her data science prowess to analyzes historical data from the popular UK TV show "Love Island," uncovering interesting patterns and correlations about contestants and winners >> possible predictions for the 2019 season.

Armed with three years of contestant data, she dives into common roles, hometown, and more - and, more importantly, illustrates how data analysis can be applied to a somewhat frivolous topic: reality television and dating shows.

The first post covers the findings, while the second dives into how she grafted the 2015-2018 contestant data and, with the help of Azure Notebooks, Blob Storage, and PowerBI, analyzed and visualized her results to make conclusions.

## [Azure Cloud Shell Tips for SysAdmins, Part II: Using the Cloud Shell Tools to Migrate](https://dev.to/azure/azure-cloud-shell-tips-for-sysadmins-part-ii-using-the-cloud-shell-tools-to-migrate-3ka8)

**by: Jay Gordon**

As an Azure Advocate, Jay spends a lot of his time learning the easiest ways for beginners to get started with Azure.

In this tutorial-style post, Jay builds on his prior post and dives deeper on migration ("lift and shift") tasks and concepts.

He breaks down various options and considerations, then walks through how to use a combination of tools to create an UbuntuLTS Linux server, and use Ansible to deploy Node.js from the NodeSource binary distributions repository.

## [Step-by-Step: Finding and Analysing Microsoft Azure Cloud Usage Costs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ITOps-Talk-Blog/Step-by-Step-Finding-and-Analyzing-Microsoft-Azure-Cloud-Usage/ba-p/718890)

**by: Sonia Cuff**

While your Azure invoice will detail your consumption of Microsoft’s Azure services, it won’t give you the *context* of your virtual resource configurations. It’s kind of like asking the electricity company to identify which home appliance used the most power, when you don’t have any smart home metering.

In this walkthrough, Sonia shares how you to use Azure Cost Analysis' grouping and filters capabilities to deliver this extra layer of context - using a common sample scenario >>identify the costs associated with specific Azure resources.

You'll learn how to set up filters, analyze different periods, create shareable custom reports, and where to go to learn more.

**by: Frank Boucher**

Frank Boucher recently presented, a workshop at TOHacks 2019 hackathon to get started with Azure. The goal was to try different Azure services, and see how we could augment an existing website using serverless function and artificial intelligence.

You can also find a video attached herewith where you will find him doing the Not a Dog workshop (which is available on GitHub). He will deploy a website and then use the Azure cognitive services Vision and an Azure Function to monitor the new images and keep only the dogs images.

## [How to Deploy Your Machine Learning Models with Azure Machine Learning](https://blog.educative.io/how-to-deploy-your-machine-learning-model/)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

In this guest post by Francesca on Educative.io's blog, readers will learn how to prepare and deploy machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning.

You'll see how to use Azure Machine Learning to get your models ready to deploy in production environments (a common pain point for many data scientists and teams), walking through a series of steps:


1. Register the model.
2. Prepare to deploy (specify assets, usage, compute target)
3. Deploy the model to the compute target.
4. Consume the deployed model (also called a web service).

## [A VS Code Extension for Managing Profiles](https://dev.to/azure/a-vs-code-extension-for-managing-profiles-ga2)

**by: Aaron Powell**

Aaron details how and why he created the VS Code Profile Switcher Extension, allowing you to create and save profiles with specific VS Code setting configurations.

As a Cloud Advocate, Aaron frequently finds himself switching between "audience optimized" VS Code settings for presentation demos (like larger font sizes and higher contrast themes) to his personal preferences for developing his own projects.

Enter the Profile Switcher: create user profiles with custom settings (e.g., "Presenter"; "Personal"). If you find yourself needing to quickly jump between VS Code settings changes >> check it out - Pull Requests welcome.
