## [Deploying Azure with Azure Resource Templates and Chef Automate](https://youtu.be/aqjvBJWexnk)

**by: Jay Gordon**

In this video tutorial, Jay Gordon walks you (interactively) through the process of using Azure with Chef, to build and deploy a website. You'll learn how to use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) with ARM Templates and the Chef Automate server for Azure, to bootstrap a new node.

All the code used in the tutorial is available in an open-source repository that you can use to create, modify and deploy your own Node.js app to Azure: https://github.com/jaydestro/chefconf2019.

You can also leave comments or discussions at the dev.to page for this article at: https://dev.to/azure/deploying-azure-with-azure-resource-templates-and-chef-automate-488k

## [MRAN Snapshots and You](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2019/05/cran-snapshots-and-you.html)

**by: David Smith**

Every day since September 17, 2014, we (Microsoft and, before the acquisition, Revolution Analytics) have archived a snapshot of the entire CRAN repository as a service to the R community.

At the time, it was an emerging concept, but now, there are several methods available to ensure that your R code works consistently, even as R and CRAN changes.

As CRAN continues to grow and changes to packages become more frequent, we're thinking about ways to adjust our approach -- but prior to doing so, would love to hear from the community.

If you use CRAN snapshots from MRAN, please share how and why you use them via a short survey -- and, if you're not familiar with the concept, or just want to learn more, read on.

## [Creating a Free Web App on Azure using Linux, Docker and Docker Compose](https://azurecasts.com/2019/05/21/creating-a-free-web-site-with-elixir-and-redis/)

**by: Rob Conery**

In episode #006, I told you that we couldn’t use Azure’s free tier (F1) unless we used the Windows operating system.

Not a big deal if we’re using Node and are happy to use Azure’s canned hosting engine. But what if we want to do our own thing with Docker?

Fear not, there's now a free tier for Linux operating system too!

In this webcast, we take advantage of the new tier for Linux and push our Docker containers to Azure for free.

**by: Jen Looper**

This is the second article in the "Azure for Spoiled People" series where Jen Looper explores Microsoft Azure (and all of its features), building a website and systematically migrating existing features from other technologies (like Firebase) to Azure.

In this segment, Jen looks at how you can stop building and deploying built assets to production in stages, and instead use Azure Pipelines to streamline the process.

By the end of this post, you should know how to get proper CI set up on your basic Vue.js app with an automated and customizable build and release process.
