## [InfoQ: The Data Science Mindset: Six Principles to Build Healthy Data-Driven Organizations](https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-science-organization-framework)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

In this article, you'll learn methods to assess whether your organization is data-driven and benchmark your data science maturity. Moreover, through real-word and applied scenarios, you'll see how to use the “Healthy Data Science Organization” framework to nurture a healthy data science mindset within your organization.

The “Healthy Data Science Organization” framework includes six key principles:

1.	Understand the Decision Process
2.	Establish Performance Metrics
3.	Architect the End-to-End Solution
4.	Build Your Toolbox of Data Science Tricks
5.	Unify Your Organization’s Data Science Vision
6.	Keep Humans in the Loop

You'll leave ready to answer "what does it really mean to be a “data-driven” organization?" and apply key principles to your teams and business goals.

## [micro:bit friend detector](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/MicroBitFriendDetector)

**by: Jim Bennett**

In this workshop (delivered for Build Junior Dev Day), Jim walks through how to create a friend detector - a wrist-mounted gadget that lights up with a :) when your friends are nearby.

In a series of detailed steps, you'll learn about BBC micro:bit - a pocket-sized computer that allows you to have loads of fun while learning digital technology and computer science - and start build and coding your project with MakeCode.

Goal: attendees learn the basics and are ready to program their own Micro:Bit projects - using block-based coding to build anything, from simple programs to light up LEDs, to robots, musical instruments and more.

## [Raspberry Pi Twitch streamer](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/RaspberryPiTwitchStreamer)

**by: Jim Bennett**

In this workshop - delivered for Build Junior Dev Day - Jim walks through how to create a Raspberry Pi Twitch streaming device.

While you *can* stream from your laptop, there's a better solution: the Twitchberry Pi - just plug in the output of your device and start streaming to Twitch with a simple command!

Background:

Recently there has been a massive rise in the popularity of live streaming video, with platforms like Twitch hosting streams not only from and for gamers -  but from software developers as well.

PS4, XBox, and other newer consoles have built-in functionality that makes it fairly easy to stream your gameplay - but what if you want stream from older consoles or the newer throwback devices, like the SNES mini classic or Sony PlayStation classic?

## [Homoglyph Attack Prevention Service](https://github.com/aribornstein/HomoglyphAttackPreventionService)

**by: Ari  Bornstein**

Homoglyphs - one or more characters with shapes that appear identical or very similar, like glyph S and $ - introduce the risk of homoglyphic obfuscation attacks on NLP models, due to the way they encode text.

This repo provides an open source Docker-based container service that takes a given text as input, convert the text to an image, process the image using OCR, and return the correct text with homoglyphs removed.

To use the service, just send a URL encoded query string of up to 200 characters (perfect for validating tweets and possible Twitter bots).

For more information on Homoglyphic attacks, see https://medium.com/@aribornstein/homoglyph-attack-prevention-with-ocr-a6741ee7c9cd

**by: Chris Noring**

This post aims to give you a high-level view of the most important Docker concepts and what commands are connected to it - perfect for beginners who haven't used Docker before, providing background before diving into Chris' Docker from the Beginning series.

Chris shares his "how I learned Docker" story, from the time he wasn't using Docker at all to his days relying on copy-pasting commands - and the moment he realized its potential and decided to learn more completely.

In this post, he focuses on teaching you how not learning a technology properly can hold you back from adding valuable tools to your toolset.

## [Does Your Organization Have Plans to Upgrade from Windows Server 2008 R2?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ITOps-Talk-Blog/Does-Your-Organization-Have-Plans-to-Upgrade-from-Windows-Server/ba-p/436483)

**by: Orin Thomas**

Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 end support on January 14 2020 is quickly approaching -- and they're still very widely deployed across various organizations.

In this post, Orin shares how in conversations with IT Pros about why their organization hasn’t moved to a newer version, he's received a variety of responses: everything from a lack of resources to perform the migration and "we have bigger fires to put out" to some simply finding that 2008 and 2008 R2 do their job pretty well.

To help the community prepare, Orin asks readers to share why THEIR organizations have (or haven't) updated and invites the community to send feedback about what resources they need to start or finish the process.

## [AzureCasts #001: A Simple Docker Deployment](https://azurecasts.com/2019/03/29/001-simple-docker-deployment/)

**by: Rob Conery**

In this video, we kick the tires and we get to know Azure by deploying a very simple web site: the sample app from the NodeJS website.

I don’t want to deal with dependencies, build processes, or unit tests just yet, instead, I'll focus on the least possible thing >> easily isolate any problems I encounter.

So, to start, I do the simplest thing I can think of: deploying the sample code from the Node.js “Getting Started” guide.

Thank you for joining us on this adventure of Azure April! It's been a blast sharing such a wide range of topics from Tweeting new blog posts with Logic Apps to Preventing Leaked Secrets.

If you missed any posts, find the whole month in reverse chronological order here.

Collaborating with so many folks on this project has been fun and challenging. The dev.to site is a fantastic place to share technical content but it does have challenges for collaboration. This post describes some of the challenges we had and what we did instead (or plan to address for next year).
