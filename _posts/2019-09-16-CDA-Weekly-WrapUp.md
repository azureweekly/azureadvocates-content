## [How to Save Money on Azure using Azure Reservations](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/09/how-to-save-money-on-azure-using-azure-reservations/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

Usually, you pay Azure services in a Pay-As-You-Go model, which gives you the pricing flexibility and agility you expect from the cloud. But, a lot of customers have services - like virtual machines or databases - which need to run continuously. 

Enter Azure Reservations, where you give the Azure team visibility into your one or three-year resource needs in advance, improving their capacity plans and forecasts. In return, reservations pass "savings" to you as discounts of up to 72 percent.

In this post, you learn how to get started -- and how you can use Azure Reservations (for certain workloads) to save money.

Just move it to the cloud. It's simple right. However some things are easier said than done. After deciding you are moving to the cloud for your workloads the hard work of moving data comes next. With transitioning to the cloud, the biggest hurdle to overcome is moving all your data. This is the part that takes work with lots of planning and preparation. It is also an understanding that this process in most cases is not an overnight job and can take weeks to months to complete.

In this blog post, Cloud Advocate Phoummala Schmitt breaks down your Azure data migration options - from asking 'why' you need migration, to 'what' you need to move, and finally the 'how.

## [[VID] Create Startups Tour: How to run with scissors: Acceleration with guardrails for your business](https://youtu.be/yEMg0byePXI)

**by: Phoummala Schmitt **

Accelerate. Speed. Velocity. These are the ways to achieve success as a startup but what about control, compliance and regulations. The Speed vs. Control challenge is real when navigating with modern technology, especially when using cloud technologies. Accelerating your business to achieve success is a must but often times the need to accelerate causes lapses in controls to meet compliance and regulation standards.

Start your business with no regrets, in this session you’ll see how cloud native tools within Azure are used as "guardrails" to give you the speed to accelerate your business while still maintaining control. Azure RBAC, Azure Policies and initiatives are used to control resource configuration, access management, and cost control while providing developers and operations to perform their job. In addition, you’ll learn how Azure Blueprints can be used when you need to scale up by combining these tools and enforcing governance across your entire Azure tenancy.

## [[VID] Create Startups Tour: Empowering Users Through Site Reliability Engineering](https://youtu.be/JZsvyWi0HCE)

**by: Jason Hand**

Users of our systems care about getting stuff done. They aren’t all that interested in how the product or service itself works, nor the underlying technology we as engineers pour our efforts into. They simply care about results. Results that make their lives better.

By shifting our perspective to align better with what users care about (i.e. results that make their lives better) we as engineers can provide a more reliable and resilient system. We can create more successful users. Ones that will not only remain long-time customers but advocates and advisors to help guide and grow the business.

In this talk we'll examine what users truly desire. We will discuss ways in which we can adjust our monitoring efforts to obtain that information. And last we will talk about how we can create a virtuous feedback loop to provide insight on how to fulfill those desires.

## [[VID] Create Startups Tour: The Trouble Learning With Learning In Complex Systems](https://youtu.be/h5sU_Nh34S0)

**by: Jason Hand**

The complexity of technology we actively design, build, and operate has eclipsed our ability to fully comprehend them. When continuous change is at the heart of our most precious systems, how do we balance protecting them while simultaneously improving the people and processes tied to making our tech more useful and valuable to end users as well as the business? A strong focus on learning as much about the system as possible is our best course of action, but learning requires both success and failure.

In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges with learning in complex systems, the relationship between high and low stakes learning opportunities as well as the cost associated. Audience members will gain exposure to ideas and techniques to help to improve operational knowledge as well as mental models associated with our ever increasingly complex systems.

By adapting to new methods of learning and creating space for more of our systems to be knowable, teams can remove the mask of process from our past to unveil a clearer view of the future.

## [[VID] Create Startups Tour: Minimum Viable Response Plan](https://youtu.be/G2sNWC39Cl4)

**by: Jason Hand**

A minimum viable product (MVP) allows you to obtain rapid feedback, and implement continuous and iterative improvements. When you put an MVP into production, however, you need to take the next step and make sure that you can respond effectively when problems inevitably arise. You need a minimum viable response plan. One that allows you to keep your MVP operational without burdening your team.

In this talk, we'll discuss the full lifecycle of an incident, what it means to be robust versus resilient when building a response plan. And we'll help you determine who is on-call when, and for which kinds of problems. We'll also talk about notifications, escalations, and how to enable learning from each problem your service encounters. This will give you the basis of a minimum viable response plan, so you and your team have a baseline to start and continuously improve up.
