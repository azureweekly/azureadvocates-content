## [Developing 10x Faster with a Surface Go, Thanks to VS Code and Azure](https://dev.to/azure/developing-10x-faster-with-a-surface-go-thanks-to-vs-code-and-azure-mho)

**by: Julien Dubois**

As developers, we always look for most efficient environment --  and that often means buying a high-end laptop.

In this post, Julien shares how he used VS Code Remote Development, a Surface Go, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines to reduce costs, get a better environment *and* improve performance.

Note: As the lead of the JHipster project, he did his performance tests and evaluation with a JHipster application -- but the results should be the same for most Java processes (or any process that uses lot of CPU, RAM, and disk).

## [Fun with R and the Noops](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2019/06/noops-and-r.html)

**by: David Smith**

Github recently debuted their Noops Challenge (https://noopschallenge.com), releasing 5 new "mysterious machines" (bots) each week in June to encourage developers to explore and experiment with various APIs. By simply interacting with the API, curious and intrepid developers learn to code, solve problems, and have fun doing it.

The challenge website includes examples in JavaScript and Python for each bot to get you started.

In this article, Cloud Advocate David Smith brings all things Noops to the R developer community, walking through how to use the 'httpr' package in R to program Hexbot Noop and demo'ing how the httpr makes it easy to interact with APIs using the GET operation (what you use to control most Noops).

As an added bonu, you'll also see and learn more about HTTP networking operations and navigating nested lists with R.

## [Automated Machine Learning User Interface — How Can We Simplify and Accelerate AI?](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/automated-machine-learning-user-interface-how-can-we-simplify-and-accelerate-ai-f82dfbf9b536)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

In this blog post, Cloud Advocate Francesca Lazzeri introduces you to the new Azure Machine Learning AutoML web user interface (UI) - now available in Preview via the Azure Portal.

The UI enables business domain experts to train ML models without requiring expertise in coding. You simply import your data, and with a few clicks, start training on it, running experiments, and capturing results.

AutoML tries a plethora of  algorithms and hyper-parameter combinations to identify the optimal model for the given user data and timeframe. From there, using the model is as easy as deploying it to the Azure ML service and using the web endpoint to generate future predictions.

Whether you're a data scientist who wants to automate part of your ML workflow so you spend more time focusing on other business objectives or a business user who doesn't have advanced data science and coding knowledge >> automated machine learning simplifies and accelerates AI.

## [Zero to AI Application: Infusing your Projects with Intelligence](https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77285?source=sessions#top-anchor)

**by: Amy Boyd**

In this recorded Build 2019 session, Amy builds end-to-end scenarios to demonstrate how to embed AI into your apps. Machine Learning often outputs a number or probability -- but to sell and promote an AI concept, you may need to put a sample in your customers hands.

To demonstrate *how* to do this, Amy walks through a  sample scenario, using Azure to build an AI application.. You'll see how to combine Azure Custom Vision, Azure Logic Apps and Power Apps to build a simple Proof of Concept for delivering your business' vision.

The code is available on GitHub for you to edit to suit your own scenario - especially relevant if you're a startup looking to pitch investors or a team who needs to get management 'buy-in' for your idea.

## [Digging Into App Center Data](https://mikecodes.net/2019/06/18/digging-into-app-center-data/)

**by: Mike James**

In this post, Mike explains how he used the new preview features of Visual Studio App Center to build a Xamarin.Forms 4.0 app and connect to a database.

App Center data allows you to quickly add data functionality to our mobile apps, including the ability to manage, persist and sync data across app installations - and is backed by Azure Cosmos DB.

You'll see how Mike built a mobile version of the Cloud Advocate directory webpage, structuring data and setting up read, create, and write access to suit the scenario.

If you'd like to try something similar,  grab the entire project on GitHub!

## [Azure Bastion – Private RDP and SSH Access to Azure VMs](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/06/azure-bastion-private-rdp-and-ssh-access-to-azure-vms/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

Azure Bastion is a new service that gives you private and fully managed RDP and SSH access to your Azure virtual machines.

Previously, if you wanted to access Azure virtual machines using RDP or SSH without a VPN connection, you were able to assign a public IP address to the virtual machine and
 then secure the connection in Azure Security Center

With Azure Bastion, you get a private and fully managed service: deploy to your Virtual Network and access your VMs *directly* from the Azure portal, using the browser over SSL.
