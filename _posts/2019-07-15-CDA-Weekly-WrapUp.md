## [How to Create an Ubuntu VM on Windows 10](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/06/how-to-create-an-ubuntu-vm-on-windows-10/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

Windows 10 more than a modern desktop operating system - it comes with IT Pro and Developer-related features built-in, including client Hyper-V.

Hyper-V - the same hypervisor that powers virtualization in Windows Server and the Microsoft Azure datacenters - allows you to create virtual machines running on Windows 10, without third-party software.

In this blog post, Thomas shows how to use Hyper-V to  create an Ubuntu VM on Windows 10.

## [AzureR: Create, Manage and Monitor Azure Services with R](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/07/01/azurer-available-create-manage-monitor-azure-services-r/)

**by: David Smith**

In this blog post, Cloud Advocate David Smith and Senior Data Scientist Hong Ooi dive into AzureR, the family of eight packages that provide tools to manage Azure resources from the open source R language.

Together, the AzureR packages provide the capability to efficiently and securely access the Azure services that are most likely to be relevant to R users, including: Azure Activity Directory, Azure Resource Manager, AzureGraph, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, Containers, Virtual Machines, and Azure Data Explorer.

David and Hong share a concrete code example that demonstrates how all these packages can be used together -- and where to go to get started.

## [Stateful Serverless: Long-running Workflows with Durable Functions](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/stateful-serverless-long-running-workflows-with-durable-functions-39ef5c96440b)

**by: Jeremy Likness**

In this blog post, Jeremy Likness introduces the concept of Durable Functions: ideal for workflows that run for a long duration based on time passed, but take up very little compute time - like Bots, which spend most of their time waiting for user input.

To make things interesting and demonstrate how Durable Functions works, Jeremy presents a turn-based adventure game. "Durable Dungeon" implements common patterns, showing you how an application can interact with Durable Functions, doing things like: posting to endpoints, querying status, and relaying the game state to the end user.

## [O'Reilly Live Online Training on Azure Machine Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/time-series-forecasting/0636920280354/)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

Announcement post for Francesca Lazzeri's upcoming three-hour online workshop on Time Series Forecasting - delivered via the O'Reilly Live Online Training platform.

In this course, Francesca walks attendees through the process of building and deploying machine learning models that can forecast the future. She will cover the core steps for building, training, and deploying your time series forecasting models. You'll build a theoretical foundation as you cover the essential aspects of time series representations, modeling, and forecasting before diving into the classical methods for forecasting time series data.

You'll walk through of some of the more common methods, including simple exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and neural networks for time series forecasting -- and gain hands-on experience applying these models to a real-world scenario, using machine learning components available in open source Python packages, such as scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

## [Thank u, Nuxt](https://burkeknowswords.com/thank-u-nuxt-d414cba80c59)

**by: Burke Holland**

It’s kinda hard to nail down exactly what Nuxt does, because it does so much: it will automatically setup routing based on your folder structure and do code splitting for static sites --
but it’s probably best known as the way that you do server-side rendering (SSR) with Vue.

 In this post, Burke gives a brief Nuxt SSR intro, then breaks down the value of Nuxt and what it takes to deploy SSR Vue application to Azure. He shows both Linux - using the new Oryx build tool  - and Windows deployments, sharing tips, best practices, and troubleshooting along the way.

## [Ethics and Artificial Intelligence (Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hehk0Mo6SfQ&list=PLl8yjZLsL_WobPtlCCIRgoU91Geokx7qK&index=4)

**by: Laurent Bugnion**

In this video series (7 videos to be published over the summer), Laurent shares recordings from his DotNetDay 2019 Ethics in AI session.

In Part 3, he introduces the concept of Bias in AI, due to various societal biases found in the data. Laurent illustrates how the main issue in AI models is not the math - but the bias present in our societies. You'll see how bias manifests in the big amounts of data needed to train AI models.

Over the course of the series, you'll learn about bias in data, other ethical issues, privacy, ways to improve the situation, and situations where we can use AI to improve inclusion in an ethical manner.

In Part 4, Laurent talks about two major bias: racial bias and gender bias. He uses examples to illustrate and explain the implications of these biases in AI models (and why they're arguably the two largest ethical issues).

The public and many developers are confused about AI, and Laurent brings the focus on the delicate topic of ethics.

Over the course of the series, you'll learn about bias in data, other ethical issues, privacy, ways to improve the situation, and situations where we can use AI to improve inclusion in an ethical manner.

## [Azure Cloud Shell Tips for SysAdmins Part IV - View and Modify your VM.](https://dev.to/azure/azure-cloud-shell-tips-for-sysadmins-part-iv-view-and-modify-your-vm-lmj)

**by: Jay Gordon**

As an Azure Advocate, Jay spends a lot of his time learning the easiest ways for beginners to get started with Azure. 

In this tutorial-style post, Jay continues his "Cloud Shell Tips" with a look at how you can use Cloud Shell in your browser to rapidly deploy, view and modify the Virtual Machine created in the previous post of the series. No matter where you are in the world, if you log into Azure Cloud Shell, you're able to work on your Azure solution. You can execute remote jobs, automate services using tools like Ansible or modify your Kubernetes cluster.

You'll get a sense of how you can use the CLI to query the Azure Resource Manager, then upgrade your VM to suit changing requirements or resource needs. And you'll get some useful DevOps advice in the process.

## [Assess and Migrate Hyper-V VMs with Azure Migrate](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/07/assess-and-migrate-hyper-v-vms-with-azure-migrate/)

**by: Thomas Maurer**

The Azure Migrate team recently launched an update to the Azure Migrate service, which can help you discover, assess, and migrate applications, infrastructure, and data from your on-prem environment to Microsoft Azure. This is excellent timing since we all know that Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are soon out of support and you get free extended security updates if you migrate your VMs to Azure.

With Azure Migrate, you can now centrally track the progress of your migration journey across multiple thrid-party and Microsoft tools. In this post, Thomas shows how you can step-by-step assess and migrate Hyper-V VMs to Azure using Azure Migrate.
