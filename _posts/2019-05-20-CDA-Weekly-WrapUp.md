## [The Urlist](https://www.theurlist.com/ )

**by: Burke Holland**

Group links, save & share your list with the world! Add links to a list, give the list a description, and create a vanity URL you can post anywhere, send to anyone, or simply save for future reference.

Built with end-to-end Azure services, The Urlist is a practical example of how you can combine Azure App Service, Authentication, Azure Container Registry, Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, App Insights, Azure Key Vault, VueJS, and TypeScript to create a practical, useful application that saves you (and the world) from bookmarking all the things.

## [Choosing a Backend For Your Mobile App Repo](https://github.com/codemillmatt/build-2019-mobile-backend)

**by: Matt Soucoup**

Choosing the backend architecture for your mobile app can be daunting. Do you go with a traditional WebAPI? Serverless? Maybe a mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) that packages several convenient components for mobile developers together? 

In this tutorial, you will learn about the pros and cons of each, the context of when each makes sense to use, and you’ll see a real-world app built using each of these backends. 

When you leave, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge of how to pick and implement the right backend for your mobile application.

**by: Brian Clark**

In this live streaming session, Brian and chat set out to implement capabilities for disabling/enabling commands and environment variables/configuration -- but that didn't quite happen (spoiler). 

As far as coding goes, the gang merged some PRs and refactored how the chat bot parses commands from chat messages >> found an issue when reading from files asynchronously in class constructors. 

Brian and chat had a lengthy discussion around this, but Brian landed on changing to do things synchronously in constructors. It's not quite working by the end of the stream (spoiler # 2) *but* everyone learned quite a bit.

**by: Jay Gordon**

In this podcast, Jay and guest Andrew Clay Shafer (Pivotal) talk about "The Conscientious Developer."

There are great ways to think of how to attack the on-call situation, even if you aren't in an on-call rotation. By being a conscientious developer and taking that extra interest in your software after deployment, you're adding incredible valuable.  

Andrew Clay Shafer stole good ideas from wherever he could and started calling them all DevOps. Andrew tries to solve more problems than he causes, but often fails. If DevOps ever caused you any problems, Andrew feels bad. If DevOps ever helped you with anything, he also apologizes.

## [Choosing Your First Cloud Platform](https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/choosing-your-first-cloud-platform/)

**by: Ruth Yakubu**

When choosing their first Cloud platform, most startups think of their current state instead of their future state, and fail to consider what happens when they start gaining traction and scaling. Unfortunately, if they don't choose a platform wisely, there may an ugly task down the road called Cloud migration: the need to lift-and-shift your solution to another Cloud platform. This results in cost and time you can't afford, when you should be focusing on building and growing your product. In some cases, your solution may be so tightly coupled with the old Cloud platform that you need to rewrite some of your code to integrate with services in the new platform.

As a startup, you cannot afford the cost and potential downtime involved in choosing the wrong Cloud platform. Knowing the right questions to ask and your business requirements and goals provide you with the ability to assess and choose the right platform for you.

Here are the top 5 key questions that startups need to consider before they choose a Cloud platform.
