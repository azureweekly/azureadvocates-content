## [Home Grown IoT Part III- Data](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2019-06-07-home-grown-iot-data/ & https://dev.to/azure/home-grown-iot-data-g18)

**by: Aaron Powell**

Data is often a cornerstone of an IoT project - and ensuring you store it in the right way dramatically impacts your end result.  jump to choosing the right database type and then determine how to work your application into it.

Instead of jumping straight to choosing your database type and making your app fit into it, Aaron encourages you to flip the direction: start by thinking about what data you're collecting, what you want to *do* with it >> find the best fit for your end goal. 

In his project, he receives three data sets labels for each monitored sensors, values from each monitored sensor, and the power his solar energy system generates (in five minute increments). 

You'll learn how he weighed his options and selected Azure Table Storage, plus how he structured his data to achieve what he's after with his final project.

## [The Ethical Implications and Risks of AI and Deep Learning](https://galasoft.ch/presentations/details/2019018)

**by: Laurent Bugnion**

There is no question that Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning will play an important role in the future (and the present!) of humanity. Taking advantage of faster and faster computers, larger and larger databases, we are able to run very complex algorithms against humongous amounts of data. This allows the creation of tools that can help us in complex areas of our lives. From autonomous vehicles to image and speech recognition, from assisting impaired humans to saving lives in critical situations, from inspecting industrial installations to sending machines in deep space or deep waters, the possibilities are amazing. But this power comes with big responsibilities. How do we take steps to minimize flaws in the data we use for our models? How do we build machines that act for the greater good? What are the risks? 

In this session, Laurent will talk about what could happen, and what we can do to prevent it.

## [DevSecOps with OWASP DevSlop](https://www.slideshare.net/TanyaJanca/devsecops-with-owasp-devslop)

**by: Tanya Janca**

For many people 'the cloud' and DevSecOps can be a bit mysterious. The OWASP DevSlop team is dedicated to learning and teaching DevSecOps via examples -- and “Patty the Pipeline” is no exception. 

In this talk, Tanya breaks down a start-to-finish demo of the system, finishing with the DevSlop team releasing their own website live on stage, using the pipeline.

You'll see how to load up an app in your editor, make a change, run it through your pipeline (and pass the security checks!), then publish it into the cloud -- as well as tools like SSL Labs, White Source Bolt, Azure DevOps Security Toolkit OWASP Zap, and more. 

Supporting videos are available on OWASP DevSlop YouTube Channel: https://aka.ms/DevSlopShow .
